# My NixOS Configuration

Welcome to my NixOS journey! üéâ

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration setup. As this is my *first* time working with coding and config editing, I'm excited to explore the power of NixOS.

## üöÄ Roadmap & Recent Additions

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed

- [x] **Module Organization**: Comprehensive restructuring with `modules/homemanager/` for user configs
- [x] **Wayland Environment**: Separated Wayland configuration into dedicated `modules/wayland.nix`
- [x] **Desktop Services**: Consolidated system services in `modules/desktop-services.nix`
- [x] **Security Enhancement**: Enhanced PAM configuration and polkit integration
- [x] **Firefox Theming**: LittleFox theme with Reversal-Dark color scheme integration
- [x] **File Manager**: Replaced Dolphin with Nautilus for better GTK integration
- [x] **Documentation**: Updated all .md files and cleaned up unnecessary comments

### üîÆ Short-term Goals

- [ ] **Security Enhancement**: Evaluate agenix or sops-nix for secrets management
- [ ] **Cleanup**: Remove deprecated lxqtniri session configuration
- [ ] **Deployment**: Test nilla or colmena for multi-host management
- [ ] **Performance**: Consider mako notification daemon for lighter resource usage
- [ ] **Input Methods**: Explore fcitx5 or ibus for multilingual support
- [ ] **Audio**: Fine-tune PipeWire configuration and add audio effects
- [ ] **Theming**: Create consistent theme across all applications
- [ ] **Backup**: Enhance backup module with cloud storage integration

### üéØ Long-term Vision

- [ ] **Multi-Host Deployment**: Deploy configuration across all devices (Earth, Mercury, Moon, Star)
- [ ] **Container Integration**: Add Podman/Docker development containers
- [ ] **Home Lab**: Integrate with self-hosted services and infrastructure
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated configuration testing and deployment
- [ ] **Documentation**: Create comprehensive setup guides and tutorials
- [ ] **Community**: Share modules and configurations with NixOS community
- [ ] **Optimization**: Profile and optimize system performance metrics
- [ ] **Security Hardening**: Implement zero-trust security model

## üìù Configuration Notes

<details>
<summary><strong>Display & Graphics</strong></summary>

**Wayland Primary:** Successfully transitioned to Wayland (Niri) as primary desktop environment. X11 applications run through xwayland-satellite for compatibility. NVIDIA performance issues resolved with proper driver configuration.

**Display Setup:** Dual environment approach - Niri for daily use, KDE available for X11-specific workflows when needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Security & Secrets</strong></summary>

**Security Overhaul (WIP):** Currently implementing enhanced security measures through the security module. Basic hardening in place with firewall, fail2ban, and AppArmor.

**Secrets Management:** Work in progress - evaluating best practices for NixOS secret management. No agenix or sops implementation yet, focusing on proper module isolation and system hardening first.

**Authentication:** Soteria polkit agent integrated for secure privilege escalation in Wayland sessions.
