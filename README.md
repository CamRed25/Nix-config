# My NixOS Configuration

Welcome to my NixOS journey! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration setup. As this is my *first* time working with coding and config editing, I'm excited to explore the power of NixOS.

## About This Repo

- **Work in Progress:** Expect ongoing changes and improvements as I learn.
- **Learning & Experimentation:** Things may not always be perfect; I'm experimenting and learning as I go.
- **Goal:** Build a solid, reproducible, and personalized NixOS system configuration.
- **Deployment Tools:** I'm considering using [nilla](https://github.com/nilla-nix/nilla) or another deployment tool.
- **Window Manager/Compositor:** Planning to include a Wayland compositor (e.g., Sway or Wayfire).

---

## Directory Structure

- **hosts/**: Future setup for managing configurations for multiple systems.
- **scripts/**: Contains rebuild and formatting scripts for my system.

## Notes

- **X11 vs Wayland:** I currently use X11 daily because Wayland with NVIDIA results in low FPS for gaming, while X11 performs normally.
- **Secrets Management:** My `configuration.nix` currently contains some sensitive commands. I plan to use [agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix) or [sops](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) for secret management once I learn more about them.

## Contributions & Collaboration

I welcome ideas, improvements, or fixes! Please open a Pull Request (PR) or share feedback and suggestions.

If you encounter issues or something isn't working, let me know. Iâ€™m likely facing similar challenges, so we can figure things out together.

## Getting Started

Feel free to clone, inspect, and adapt this configuration for your own needs.
