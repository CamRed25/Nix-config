# My NixOS Configuration

Welcome to my NixOS journey! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration setup. As this is my *first* time working with coding and config editing, I'm excited to explore the power of NixOS.

## About This Repo

- **Work in Progress:** Expect ongoing changes and improvements as I learn more about NixOS, its ecosystem, and best practices.
- **Learning & Experimentation:** This repository is a sandbox for trying out new modules, desktop environments, and deployment strategies. Mistakes and experiments are part of the process!
- **Goal:** Build a solid, reproducible, and personalized NixOS system configuration that can be easily deployed to multiple machines.
- **Deployment Tools:** I'm considering using [nilla](https://github.com/nilla-nix/nilla), [colmena](https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena), or other deployment tools for managing multiple hosts.
- **Window Manager/Compositor:** Planning to include a Wayland compositor (e.g., Sway or Wayfire) in addition to X11-based setups.

## Notes

- **X11 vs Wayland:** I currently use X11 daily because Wayland with NVIDIA results in low FPS for gaming, while X11 performs normally. I plan to revisit Wayland as support improves.
- **Secrets Management:** My `configuration.nix` currently contains some sensitive commands. I plan to use [agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix) or [sops](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) for secret management once I learn more about them.
- **Documentation:** Each major folder contains a `.md` file with more details. Refer to those for specifics on hosts, modules, desktop environments, and pins.
- **Changelog Versioning:** 0.1.0 updates will revolve around the updating of npins (pin sources and versions).
- **npins Customization:** Most of the npins section can be removed if you wish to simplify or customize your own setup. In the future, I will comment on which parts are essential and which can be safely removed or changed according to your own vision.
