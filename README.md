# My NixOS Configuration

Welcome to my NixOS journey! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration setup. As this is my *first* time working with coding and config editing, I'm excited to explore the power of NixOS.

## About This Repo

- **Work in Progress:** Expect ongoing changes and improvements as I learn more about NixOS, its ecosystem, and best practices.
- **Learning & Experimentation:** This repository is a sandbox for trying out new modules, desktop environments, and deployment strategies. Mistakes and experiments are part of the process!
- **Goal:** Build a solid, reproducible, and personalized NixOS system configuration that can be easily deployed to multiple machines.
- **Deployment Tools:** I'm considering using [nilla](https://github.com/nilla-nix/nilla), [colmena](https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena), or other deployment tools for managing multiple hosts.
- **Window Manager/Compositor:** Planning to include a Wayland compositor (e.g., Sway or Wayfire) in addition to X11-based setups.

## Directory Structure & Documentation

- **hosts/**: Per-machine configurations. See [Hosts.md](hosts/Hosts.md) for details about each host and their roles.
- **de/**: Desktop environment configurations. See [DesktopEnviroments.md](de/DesktopEnviroments.md) for a list of supported environments and usage notes.
- **modules/**: Custom reusable NixOS modules. See [Modules.md](modules/Modules.md) for documentation on available modules and their purposes.
- **npins/**: Pin definitions for external sources and channels. See [Npins.md](npins/Npins.md) for a list of pins and future plans.
- **scripts/**: Contains rebuild and formatting scripts for my system (not yet fully documented).
- **changelog.asciidoc**: Project changelog with detailed version history. See [changelog.asciidoc](changelog.asciidoc) for a summary of changes and updates.

## Notes

- **X11 vs Wayland:** Currently using X11 daily due to better NVIDIA gaming performance. Will revisit Wayland as support improves.
- **Secrets Management:** Sensitive commands are present in `configuration.nix`. Planning to use [agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix) or [sops](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) for secrets in the future.
- **Documentation:** Each major folder has a `.md` file with more details. Refer to those for specifics on hosts, modules, DEs, and pins.
- **Changelog Versioning:** 0.1.0 updates focus on npins (pin sources and versions).
- **npins Customization:** Most of the npins section can be removed or customized. Future comments will clarify which parts are essential.
- **Note:** `./modules/home` and `./de/homede` are not in use currently, but may be in the future.
- **.gitignore:** `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` are included because I use npins to manage external dependencies, leveraging its "npins import-flake" feature.
