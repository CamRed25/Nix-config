# Desktop Environments

This folder contains configuration files for the desktop environments I have set up using Nix.

## Configured Desktop Environments

- GNOME
- KDE Plasma
- Any other desktops I plan on using or configure will be here.

## Usage

Feel free to test out what I have installed and configured for each desktop environment, even if it's not much. I do suggest you look into the configuration files to see what is being set up, since I do not provide extensive documentation for each environment. I'll try to include any and all documentation I can for each in the future.
