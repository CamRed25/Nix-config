# Desktop Environments

This folder contains configuration files for the desktop environments I have set up using Nix.

## Configured Desktop Environments

- **GNOME**
- **KDE Plasma**
- Any other desktops I plan on using or configuring will be added here.

## Current Desktop Environments

- **kde.nix**: Configuration for KDE Plasma desktop environment. Currently using X11 instead of Wayland due to issues with gaming and NVIDIA drivers.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the configurations for each desktop environment. I recommend reviewing the configuration files to understand what is being set up, as detailed documentation may not be available for every environment. I will try to improve documentation over time.
