# Desktop Environments

This folder contains configuration files for the desktop environments I have set up using Nix.

## Folder Structure

**kde.nix:**
Configuration for KDE Plasma desktop environment. Currently using X11 instead of Wayland due to issues with gaming and NVIDIA drivers.

**niri.nix:**
Configuration for the Niri Wayland compositor, including related utilities and portals.

**lxqtniri.nix:**
~~Experimental configuration attempting to run LXQt with Niri/Wayland.~~
**[DEPRECATED]** Not recommended for production use.

## Configured Desktop Environments

- [x] **KDE Plasma**
- [x] **Niri (Wayland)**
- [ ] ~~**LXQt with Niri (experimental, deprecated)**~~

Any other desktops I plan on using or configuring will be added here.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the configurations for each desktop environment. I recommend reviewing the configuration files to understand what is being set up, as detailed documentation may not be available for every environment. I will try to improve documentation over time.

## Former Desktop Environments

This section will serve as a record of previous or experimental desktop environments, including attempts to move to tiling window managers or when switching to other DEs for a change. Think of it as a graveyard of configs and experiments.
